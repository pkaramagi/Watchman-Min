<p>The ministry of The Watchman is called to awaken the church towards the reality of the soon return of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>The Watchman is the international ministry of Endtime teacher Joseph Kabuleta By linking contemporary news to the prophecies of the Bible, we have set out to demonstrate to all peoples that the most talked-about event of the past 2000 years -- the return of the Lord Jesus Christ for His saints -- is indeed just around the corner. We are awakening our generation to the fact that we are indeed the generation that will witness the return of the Lord.</p>
<p>We do this through various ministry platforms; audio, visual and through a written newsletter from the Watchman. Through an effective radio ministry that has been running since February 2014, the Watchman has built an army of enthusiasts who are willing to carry on the Endtime message to the very ends of the world.</p>

<p>Our calling and purpose is to ensure that as many people are possibly are snatched from the well-crafted deception that the Lord Jesus Christ warned would a major feature of the time preceding his return.</p>
